# Unified gRPC Pipeline

The observer Expert Advisor serialises trade and metric events with the
Protocol Buffer definitions in `proto/trade_event.proto` and
`proto/metric_event.proto`.  Events are sent to a Python service over gRPC,
replacing the previous Arrow Flight and sharedâ€‘memory transports.

The EA loads `observer_grpc.dll` which exposes helpers to encode the messages
and to transmit them using `GrpcSendTrade` and `GrpcSendMetrics`.  The target
host and port are configured via the `GrpcServerHost` and `GrpcServerPort`
inputs.

On the server side `scripts/grpc_log_service.py` implements the
`tbot.LogService` with `LogTrade` and `LogMetrics` RPCs.  Each request is
appended to CSV files for downstream processing.

Protobuf and gRPC stubs can be regenerated by running:

```bash
./scripts/gen_protos.sh
```

Start the logging service with:

```bash
python -m scripts.grpc_log_service --port 50051
```

This setup provides a single, reliable path for streaming telemetry from
MetaTrader to Python.
