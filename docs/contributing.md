# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving BotCopier.

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Review the [coding standards](coding_standards.md).
2. Run all [tests](testing.md) and ensure they pass.
3. Use `pre-commit` to apply formatting and static analysis:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

Please open an issue for major changes so we can discuss the approach.
